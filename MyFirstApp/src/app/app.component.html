          captain ever [1] .He captained the Indian national cricket team in

      <h3>International career</h3>
      <p class="information" id="myPtag" name="somename">
        In the second match of the series, Dhoni, in his fifth one-day
        international, scored 148 in Visakhapatnam off only 123 deliveries.
        Dhoni's 148 surpassed the earlier record for the highest score by an
        Indian wicket-keeper,[55] a record that he would re-write before the end
        of the year. Dhoni had few batting opportunities in the first two games
        of the Sri Lankan bilateral ODI series (October–November 2005) and was
        promoted to No. 3 in the third ODI at Sawai Mansingh Stadium (Jaipur).
        Sri Lanka had set India a target of 299 after a Kumar Sangakkara century
        and, in reply, India lost Tendulkar early. Dhoni was promoted to
        accelerate the scoring and ended the game with an unbeaten 183 off 145
        balls, winning the game for India.[56] The innings was described in
        Wisden Almanack (2006) as 'Uninhibited, yet anything but crude'.[57] The
        innings set various records including the highest individual score in
        ODI cricket in the second innings,[58] a record only broken after seven
        years by Shane Watson.[59] Dhoni ended the series with the highest run
        aggregate (346)[60] and was awarded the Man of the Series award for his
        efforts. In December 2005, Dhoni was rewarded a B-grade contract by the
        BCCI.[61] Dhoni bowling in the nets. He rarely bowled at international
        level. India scored 328 in 50 overs with Dhoni contributing 68 in their
        first match of 2006 against Pakistan. However, the team finished poorly,
        scoring just 43 runs in the last eight overs and lost the match due to
        Duckworth-Lewis method.[62] In the third match of the series, Dhoni came
        in with India in a precarious situation and scored 72 runs off just 46
        balls that included 13 boundaries to help India take a 2–1 lead in the
        series.[63][64] The final match of the series had a repeat performance
        as Dhoni scored 77 runs off 56 balls to enable India win the series
        4–1.[65] Due to his consistent ODI performances, Dhoni overtook Ricky
        Ponting as number one in the ICC ODI Rankings for batsmen on 20 April
        2006 becoming the fastest batsman to do so, in 42 innings.[66] His reign
        lasted just a week as Adam Gilchrist's performance against Bangladesh
        moved him to the top spot.[67] Two cancelled series in Sri Lanka, one
        due to the withdrawal of South Africa from the Unitech Cup due to
        security concerns[68] and the replacement three-match ODI bilateral
        series against Sri Lanka washed due to rain,[69] was India's prelude to
        another disappointing tournament – DLF Cup 2006-07. Dhoni scored 43 runs
        as the team lost twice in three games and did not qualify for the
        finals. India's lack of preparation showed in the 2006 ICC Champions
        Trophy as they lost to West Indies and Australia, though Dhoni scored a
        half-century against West Indies. The story of the ODI series in South
        Africa was the same for both Dhoni and India as Dhoni scored 139 runs in
        4 matches and India lost the series 4–0. From the start of the West
        Indies ODI series, Dhoni had played 16 matches, hit just two fifties and
        averaged 25.93. Dhoni received criticism on his wicket-keeping technique
        from former wicket-keeper Syed Kirmani.[70] Yet, for his performances in
        2006, he was named in the World ODI XI by the ICC.[71]
