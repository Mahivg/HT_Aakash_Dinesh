            Mahendra Singh Dhoni (born 7 July 1981), was a former international
            cricketer who plays as a wicketkeeper and a right-handed middle
            order batsman. His power hitting ability made his reputation as a
            finisher. He is widely considered as one of the greatest white ball
            cricket captain ever [1] .He captained the Indian national cricket
            team in limited-overs formats from 2007 to 2017 and in Test cricket
            from 2008 to 2014. He led the team to three ICC titles (2007 ICC
            World Twenty20, 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup and 2013 ICC Champions
            Trophy) and brought the Indian cricket team to number one position
            in ICC test rankings in 2009.[3][4] He is current captain of Chennai
            super king in IPL. He also led CSK to win the 2010, 2011, 2018 and
            2021 editions of IPL.

        <h3>International career</h3>
        <p class="information">
          In the second match of the series, Dhoni, in his fifth one-day
          international, scored 148 in Visakhapatnam off only 123 deliveries.
          Dhoni's 148 surpassed the earlier record for the highest score by an
          Indian wicket-keeper,[55] a record that he would re-write before the
          end of the year. Dhoni had few batting opportunities in the first two
          games of the Sri Lankan bilateral ODI series (October–November 2005)
          and was promoted to No. 3 in the third ODI at Sawai Mansingh Stadium
          (Jaipur). Sri Lanka had set India a target of 299 after a Kumar
          Sangakkara century and, in reply, India lost Tendulkar early. Dhoni
          was promoted to accelerate the scoring and ended the game with an
          unbeaten 183 off 145 balls, winning the game for India.[56] The
          innings was described in Wisden Almanack (2006) as 'Uninhibited, yet
          anything but crude'.[57] The innings set various records including the
          highest individual score in ODI cricket in the second innings,[58] a
          record only broken after seven years by Shane Watson.[59] Dhoni ended
          the series with the highest run aggregate (346)[60] and was awarded
          the Man of the Series award for his efforts. In December 2005, Dhoni
          was rewarded a B-grade contract by the BCCI.[61] Dhoni bowling in the
          nets. He rarely bowled at international level. India scored 328 in 50
          overs with Dhoni contributing 68 in their first match of 2006 against
          Pakistan. However, the team finished poorly, scoring just 43 runs in
          the last eight overs and lost the match due to Duckworth-Lewis
          method.[62] In the third match of the series, Dhoni came in with India
          in a precarious situation and scored 72 runs off just 46 balls that
          included 13 boundaries to help India take a 2–1 lead in the
          series.[63][64] The final match of the series had a repeat performance
          as Dhoni scored 77 runs off 56 balls to enable India win the series
          4–1.[65] Due to his consistent ODI performances, Dhoni overtook Ricky
          Ponting as number one in the ICC ODI Rankings for batsmen on 20 April
          2006 becoming the fastest batsman to do so, in 42 innings.[66] His
          reign lasted just a week as Adam Gilchrist's performance against
          Bangladesh moved him to the top spot.[67] Two cancelled series in Sri
          Lanka, one due to the withdrawal of South Africa from the Unitech Cup
          due to security concerns[68] and the replacement three-match ODI
          bilateral series against Sri Lanka washed due to rain,[69] was India's
          prelude to another disappointing tournament – DLF Cup 2006-07. Dhoni
          scored 43 runs as the team lost twice in three games and did not
          qualify for the finals. India's lack of preparation showed in the 2006
          ICC Champions Trophy as they lost to West Indies and Australia, though
          Dhoni scored a half-century against West Indies. The story of the ODI
          series in South Africa was the same for both Dhoni and India as Dhoni
          scored 139 runs in 4 matches and India lost the series 4–0. From the
          start of the West Indies ODI series, Dhoni had played 16 matches, hit
          just two fifties and averaged 25.93. Dhoni received criticism on his
          wicket-keeping technique from former wicket-keeper Syed Kirmani.[70]
          Yet, for his performances in 2006, he was named in the World ODI XI by
          the ICC.[71]
